     Out of the various things that give you
     happiness, travelling must be at the top of
     your list. However, in these extraordinary
     times when travelling is restricted, you can
     explore some lesser known places in India
     online and create a virtual tour on any one.
     The virtual tour video should be between 2-3
     minutes. You have to give your voice-over
     explaining the tour.
