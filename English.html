<h2> Holiday Homework</h2>
Stories are a lovely way of travelling into a fantasy world of
excitement, adventure or reliving happy memories. Write a
short story within 250-300 words about any wonderful,
unforgettable experience. It could be either real or
imaginary, but should be narrated in a way that keeps the
reader engrossed.

    My family went to Portofino, a town in italy. We reached there through an intercity train when we got out it was raining and the raining stopped soon. There was the beautiful sea and it was surrounded by restaurants and shops on one side and a mountain on the other. It was very peaceful and there were very few people. It looked very alluring .We decided to go on a hike on the mountain.There was a warning for a thunderstorm but we decided to ignore it as the Indian MET  is often inaccurate and we predicted the same for Italy and go on with the hike of the mountain. We came down to have lunch. While sitting in the restaurant we heard a lot of commotion. We went out to see what it was all about and saw that there was a hurricane. We all immediately took shelter. After the hurricane was over we waited for 1 hour for the bus to arrive and take us back to the train station. At the train station we got to know that the trains have been cancelled as the hurricane broke the electric lines.the network was down so our phones stopped working and we didn’t know italian so we couldn’t understand whatever was written on the boards. We were struggling to get back to milan. We bought a map and tried to find a way back. Thankfully we met a lovely swiss couple who helped us get to a bus station. On the bus we met a few pakistani people who helped us to get to the train station. There we got ourselves a ticket and reached Milan at midnight. it was an eventful day which showed people are helping across the globe.
